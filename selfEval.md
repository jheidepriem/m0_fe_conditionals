# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I'm feeling a lot better now that I've gone through everything a few times.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I feel pretty confident that I know how they operate. I definitely still need more practice writing the code.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
The if and else statements are making a lot of sense to me at this point.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent a lot of time on this assignment, more than any of the others. I gave a lot of time and knocked out some of the other assignments early. I'm really glad I did, because I got sick over the weekend and would have had a hard time completing everything otherwise.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think when I'm feeling caught up and probably between mods 0 and 1, I'll practice more on my own.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I plan on discussing issues that others had when we meet for our small group.
